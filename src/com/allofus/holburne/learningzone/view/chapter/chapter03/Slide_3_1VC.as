The confident young artistâ€™s portrait is full of allusions to the past: on his easel is a view of the Temple of Vesta above the waterfall at Tivoli, a reference to his recent travels around Rome.  The pose with one hand on the hip, fashionably long hair and rich ochre coat are borrowed from the seventeenth-century master Van Dyck.</p>";
